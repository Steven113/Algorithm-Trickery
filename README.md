# Algorithm-Trickery
A collection of implementations of high-performance algorithms, written in C# and unit tested in Visual Studio 2015.

## Usage
The AlgorithmTrickery folder contains different classes for different types of algorithms. The algorithms are implemented using generic static functions so that they can be used anywhere.

You can either use the .dll file with all the classes which is compiled for the .NET Framework 4.5.2 or you can take the source code out of the AlgorithmTrickery folder and compile it as part of your own project.
