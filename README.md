# Algorithm-Trickery
A collection of implementations of high-performance algorithms, written in C# and unit tested in Visual Studio 2015.

## Usage
The AlgorithmTrickery folder contains different classes for different types of algorithms. The algorithms are implemented using generic static functions so that they can be used anywhere. You should be able to copy a class you need for your purposes. The Visual Studio project is a Class Library project, so you should be able to export the code as a library if you would rather have a library.
